The purpose of this program was to challenge ourselves to create a Tic Tac Toe game using techniques and tools learned during our 2 weeks at General Assembly. This includes JavaScript, JQuery, HTML and CSS. 

On load the screen will the game board and players can choice between 3 characters, and either being “X” or “O”. Players can have a choice of either Player VS Player mode or Player VS Dumbass mode this mode uses a very simple, very easily beatable AI. Said AI does not actually play the game but rather randomly selects a square every turn. 

Rules
1) Players cannot select a square more than once.
2) Players must choose either “X” or “O” before commencing game. 
3) VS mode is the default gamemode. 
4) You will be insulted if you lose against the AI.
